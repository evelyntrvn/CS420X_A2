I was very excited to play around with the video and wanted to focus on the colors of the video input. Almost like a filter or photo editor, I wanted the user to have control over the levels of red, green, and blue for their video. To utilize the randomness and noise, I referenced some code from the readings and wanted the noise to act like rays of light. It gives the video a glow-like filter and the feedback levels control the transparency of the original video. With all of those controls, the user can play around and create different moods and color schemes for their current image. I think itâ€™s pretty interesting to see how the varying levels of each color with the light and feedback levels can really change the feel. 

After reviewing with a partner, they enjoyed playing around the with interface. They did mention that it bothered them that the shine level was 0-10 while the rest were 0-1. To improve that, I'd probably adjust the noise function so it could fit the 0-1 range or move the shine input to the bottom.
